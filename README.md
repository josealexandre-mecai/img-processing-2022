# Project Title: Feature Extraction Analysis on Electronic Waste
#
# Abstract: 
The purpose of our project is to analyze a set of images related to Electronic Waste, by working with Feature Extraction techniques such as GLCM and LBP, and then interpreting the results based on Distance Functions (Euclidean, Cosine, Manhattan) and Multidimensional Projection (t-SNE, MDS or PCA). In addition, with the application of a clustering algorithm, we will define a Bag of Visual Words for content-based image retrieval in order to identify the best combination of features.

The inputs were obtained by taking photos of the Scrap / Waste Disposal operation of a large IT company, which allowed us to get a variety of electronic waste images, like Printed Circuit Boards, Connectors, Cables and Wires, Batteries, Screens, Magnetic Tapes, Metals, etc.
